# weatherbot-discord.py
The picking process has two steps. First, you pick the continent in which the city you're interested in is located, then you pick the specific city from a continent map. Due to discord limitations (max emoji count is 20 specific emojis) there can only be 20 cities listed on any continent.

FOR THIS BOT TO WORK YOU NEED YOUR OWN DISCORD TOKEN AND WEATHERAPI.COM TOKEN. 
PUT YOUR DISCORD TOKEN IN A TXT FILE NAMED "discord-token.txt" AND YOUR WEATHERAPI TOKEN IN A FILE NAMED "weatherapi-token.txt"
sorry for using capslock xx
